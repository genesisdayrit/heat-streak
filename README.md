# heat-streak

The goal of this project is to be able to feed general activity data through a UI to produce streak maps, similar to the one that shows on GitHub profiles so that users can flaunt their streaks

This will likley start with manual uploads, but aim to eventually support common activity streams, such as Twitter, Notion, etc.

Users will upload data in csv form with the following format:
- Date
- Activity Count (e.g. tweets, posts, etc.)

Users will also be able to embed their heatstreeak on personal webpages to show how they're doing with activities that they are proud of.
